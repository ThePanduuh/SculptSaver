This folder is for Z-Butt bases.
The SculptSaver_Body file is designed with supports preinserted to print the gap which the fork slides into without sagging (I have a meh printer and haven't tuned bridging).
The SculptSaver_Closure is the mating part to house the sculpt in the SculptSaver_Body.
The Sculpting_Fork file allows you to flip the Z-Butt sculpting base upside down and use the SculptSaver_Body as a means to hold the sculpt. The fork will secure the base into the body, and stores away nicely in the top of the body.
