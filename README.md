Currently supports Z-butt because that's what I designed it around.

GTB bases are supported, but with the base being thicker and the cap sitting lower, the sculpt sits lower in the "working" position than the Z-Butt equivalent.

Z-Butt files will end in \_Z.

GTB files end in \_G.

The Fork and Closure files are the same between the two models.

For a complete set you will need to print:
- 1x Body
- 1x Closure
- 1x Fork (optional)

The SculptSaver_Body file is designed with supports preinserted to print in the gap which the fork slides into without sagging. They should cut away with a pocket knife pretty easily. **Please be careful removing them with a pocket knife.**

The SculptSaver_Closure is the mating part to house the sculpt in the SculptSaver_Body. This keeps the sculpting base housed in the body.

The Sculpting_Fork file allows you to flip the sculpting base upside down and use the SculptSaver_Body as a means to hold the sculpt. The fork will secure the sculpting base to the body while you sculpt, and stores away nicely in the top of the body when not in use.

I printed on an XYZ DaVinci 2.0 Duo w/ RepRap 0.92 using PrusaSlicer (FDM printer). There is no need for supports since the only thing that requires supports had supports added in the design.

Estimated print times using FDM printer:

SculptSaver_Body: 2.5 hours @ 0.2mm layer height, 20% infill

SculptSaver_Closure: 15 minutes @ 0.1mm layer height, 20% infill

Sculpting_Fork: 15 minutes @ 0.1mm layer height, 20% infill
