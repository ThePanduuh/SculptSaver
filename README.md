# SculptSaver
An artisan keycap sculpt box to protect your clay sculpts from pets, kids, etc.

Currently supports Z-butt because that's what I designed it around.

Z-Butt files will end in \_Z.

I hope to add GTB/TheGlyph bases as these are very common among experienced makers who have large scale production systems and custom butt molds with makers mark.
